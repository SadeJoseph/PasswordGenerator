# PasswordGenerator


## Overview
I was tasked with creating code in order to get the password generator functioning using our new Javascript skills. 

## Criteria
Here is the password criteria that needed to be met in this challenge:

-Once the 'Generate password' button is clicked by the user, a password should be generated.
  - A  series of prompts shhould appear , these include;
   1. Length of password (10-64 characters).
   2. Character types inclusing lowercase, uppercase special characters and numeric characters.

Once these prompts are answered password should be randomly generated and displayed.
